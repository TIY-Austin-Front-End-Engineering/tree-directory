# Tree Directory

## Description
This assignment will test your knowledge of how paths, directories and tree data structures are related.


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand how to translate a directory structure to a tree data structure.
* Understand how root relative and document relative paths relate to trees.
* Understand how to construct root relative and document relative paths.


## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * a hand drawn image of a tree data structure that mimics the directory structure of the `components` directory within this repository.
  * an answers.txt file with the answers to all of the questions about the directory.

### Requirements

* The `components` directory should be the root of the drawn tree.
* Your answers should be in the format:
	> *question#*) *answer*

	> *question#*) *answer*

	> *question#*) *answer*
	
	For example:
	> 1) 7

	> 2) node

	Your homework will be graded automatically, so if it is not in this format it will be marked wrong.


## Normal Mode
1. Using pen / pencil and paper, draw out a tree representation of the `components` directory within this repository.
2. Answer the following questions

	###### Question 1:
	What is the root relative path to the `errors.js` file?

	###### Question 2:
	How many children does the input directory have?

	###### Question 3:
	How many descendents does the input directory have?

	###### Question 4:
	How leaf nodes are there in the directory tree?

	###### Question 5:
	What is the document relative path from the `d.json` file to the `events.js` file?

	###### Question 6:
	What is the document relative path from the `all` directory to the `models.js` file?

	###### Question 7:
	What is the document relative path from the `events.js` file to the `b.js` file?
